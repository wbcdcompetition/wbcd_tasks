# Track 1: Logistics Picking

> **Robot:** Unitree G1 · **Sponsor:** Unitree

## Overview

This track bridges the gap between research and real-world application with standardized benchmark tasks for remote operation. It focuses on critical industry metrics like speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Participants use various methods including VR and motion capture to perform mobile manipulation tasks.

## Robot Platform

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Robot | Unitree G1 Humanoid |
| End Effectors | A pair of end effectors (clamps, 3-finger, or 5-finger dexterous hands) |
| Control Method | VR headset or inertial motion capture suit |

## Task Definition

### Picking in Logistics Scenarios

The robot must transfer items from shelves at multiple heights to a transport vehicle in the unloading area within a fixed time limit.

- **High shelves** — Robot in upright position
- **Low shelves** — Robot in bent position
- **Ground shelves** — Robot in crouched position

There is no limit on the number of items transferred per operation, but items must be prevented from falling to the ground.

## Workspace Setup
