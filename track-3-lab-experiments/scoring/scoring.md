# Scoring Rubric – Track 3: Lab Experiments

## Overview

Teams are evaluated on three dimensions across all steps: **Task Completion**, **Precision & Safety**, and **Efficiency**. Each step is scored independently, then combined for a final ranking.

---

## Step 1: Sample Loading & Seating

### Task Completion

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Full marks | All target positions populated with correctly seated samples |
| Partial | ≥ 50% of positions populated; some samples not fully seated |
| Minimal | < 50% of positions populated |
| Zero | No samples loaded, or task not attempted |

### Precision & Safety

| Penalty | Trigger |
|---------|---------|
| Minor (–N pts) | Sample not fully seated but stays in rack |
| Major (–2N pts) | Sample dropped on workspace |
| Critical (–3N pts) | Sample broken or rack damaged |

### Efficiency

- **Time limit:** <!-- TODO: e.g., 5 minutes -->
- **Bonus:** Completing under <!-- TODO --> seconds

## Step 2: Instrument Interfacing

### Task Completion

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Full marks | All specified samples correctly transferred to target tray |
| Partial | ≥ 50% correct transfers |
| Minimal | < 50% correct transfers |
| Zero | No successful transfers |

### Precision & Safety

| Penalty | Trigger |
|---------|---------|
| Minor | Sample placed in wrong position (but corrected) |
| Major | Wrong sample transferred (not corrected) |
| Critical | Collision with instrument interface; sample breakage |

### Efficiency

- **Time limit:** <!-- TODO -->
- **Bonus:** <!-- TODO -->

## Step 3: Mobile Phase Management

### Task Completion

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Full marks | Both caps properly handled; tubing relocated to target bottle |
| Partial | One cap handled correctly; tubing partially relocated |
| Minimal | Cap or tubing interaction attempted but not completed |
| Zero | Task not attempted |

### Precision & Safety

| Penalty | Trigger |
|---------|---------|
| Minor | Cap cross-threaded but recovered |
| Major | Bottle tipped (but no spill) |
| Critical | Spill; bottle knocked over; tubing damaged |

### Efficiency

- **Time limit:** <!-- TODO -->
- **Bonus:** <!-- TODO -->

---

## Final Score Calculation

```
Final Score = Step1_Score + Step2_Score + Step3_Score
```

<!-- TODO: Define exact point values and weights once finalized -->

### Tiebreaker

In case of a tied final score, the team with the **lower total time** across all steps wins.
