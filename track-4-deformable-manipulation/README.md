# Track 4: Deformable Object Manipulation

> **Robot:** ARX · **Sponsor:** ARX

## Overview

This track evaluates robotic manipulation of deformable objects in manufacturing and service scenarios. Using a T-shirt as the representative flexible object, teams must demonstrate sophisticated perception and control capabilities.

## Task Definition

### Step 1: Load T-shirt

Pick up and position the T-shirt into the workspace for manipulation.

**Success Criteria:** T-shirt is correctly positioned in the designated workspace area.

### Step 2: Fold T-shirt

Fold the T-shirt into a neat and consistent configuration.

**Success Criteria:** T-shirt is folded into a predefined target shape with acceptable tolerance.

### Step 3: Unload T-shirt

Remove the T-shirt from the workspace after manipulation is complete.

**Success Criteria:** Folded T-shirt is placed in the designated output area without unfolding.

## Core Skills Assessed

- Perception and tracking of deformable objects
- Compliant grasping and manipulation
- Control of object deformation and alignment
- Consistency and quality of the final folded result
