# Track 4: Deformable Manipulation

## Overview

This task evaluates manipulation of deformable objects. Using a T-shirt as the representative flexible object, the system must demonstrate perception and control capabilities for loading, folding, and unloading.

## Task Rules

### Step 1: Load T-shirt

Pick up and position the T-shirt into the workspace for manipulation.

- T-shirt correctly positioned in the designated area

### Step 2: Fold T-shirt

Fold the T-shirt into a neat and consistent configuration.

- T-shirt folded into the predefined target shape with acceptable tolerance

### Step 3: Unload T-shirt

Remove the folded T-shirt from the workspace.

- Folded T-shirt placed in the designated output area without unfolding
